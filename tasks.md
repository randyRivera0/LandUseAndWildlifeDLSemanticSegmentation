## Weekly Objectives:

### Tasks
- [x] Join train, val and test graphics (also scale them)
- [x] Use best and last pt
- [ ] Test img: separate the labels, boxes and Semantic Segmentation
- [x] Discover which metrics is using the system to stop the iterations and use the segmentation oriented metrics
- [ ] Organize and join collab with github also using a remote running server
- [x] Learn about SAHI
- [ ] Use SAM for land segmentation
- [ ] Add more img to val
- [ ] Use jupyter to track progress
- [ ] Show real and predictions together
- [ ] Small Object Detection
- [ ] Continue with the pretrain
- [ ] Wandb or TensorBoard
- [ ] Validation with SAHI
- [ ] Read the paper, the NGeo contest and find funding for the next year
- [ ] SAM with object Detection Dataset
- [ ] Use galapagos videos with coco, sam and the drones dataset
- [ ] Report of funding

### Questions
- Torch out of memory solved removing flag amp=False
- Is SAHI for semantic segmentation or only for object detection?

### Next Steps
- Integrate Use of Land and develop functionality for biologists
